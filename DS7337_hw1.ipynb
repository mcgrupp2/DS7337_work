It differs from the book example, as this method uses regex to separate the words. When I used the python function `set()` alone, as the example shows in the book, it only returned each unique unicode character, not the words. It seems like this was due to the format of the text I was attempting to use `set()`, but maybe there was another cause? Either way, the function I've written works well for what I need.

    "The above table shows the result for the first set of texts. The lexical diversity scores for each of these are in the far right column. These results were very surprising. It seems as though there are 2 sides to this question from an assumption standpoint. Either the \"youngest\" books would have the most lexical diversity, as the young vocab needs exposure to many different words to mature nicely, or the inverse is true, the \"older\" books are more diverse as the more mature vocab can handle a more lexically diverse text. Going in to the exercise, the preconceived notion that I had was more in line with the latter of the two options suggested. It seemed like the lexical diversity would be greater in the books that were intended for older, more experienced readers. The results that were obtained seemed to go against this notion slightly. There is no particular trend to be found with the 3 texts that were evaluated. Even with the second and third texts, which seem to be a part of a series, so a comparison may be more similar, it goes against what was expected. These results were so surprising that an additional 3 graded texts were obtained to test this notion.\n",

The youngest grade had the most unique vocabulary words and the middle grade had the least. This result wasn't as surprising, but that is because of the obvious problem of different numbers of total words. To build on this, we can see that the \"4th Year\" text has the highest vocab count, however it is the least diverse, and the \"5th Year\" has the least number of unique words, but the most lexically diverse. Again, these results were suspect, and additional texts were evaluated."
